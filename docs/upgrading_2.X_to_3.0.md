## Upgrading from 2.X to 3.0

The biggest change in 3.0 is the requirement for PHP 8. There are some minor type-hint related
changes, however the main APIs are the same as 2.X.

In addition note the following:

 * `somnambulist/domain` has been updated and is now namespaced `Somnambulist\Components\Domain`
 * `somnambulist/collection` has been updated and is now namespaced `Somnambulist\Components\Collection`
